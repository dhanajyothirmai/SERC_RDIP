<h2 style="background-color:#FCBFB2;"> Introduction </h2>
<p>Digital media is, at its most basic
level, information reduced to a
machine readable language:<br>
The machine processes this
information and then returns it
to you in a specified form (video,
text, image, interactive content).<br>
It also provides an interface
between you and the
information.<br>
Web technologies are designed
to facilitate the transfer of these
files between machines on a
network.</p>

<h2 style="background-color:#FCBFB2;"> World Wide Web (WWW) </h2>
<p> The INTERNET is a network
of networks, the global
system of interconnected
computer networks that
links billions of devices
worldwide.<br>
The World Wide Web is an
application, a service that
uses the Internet
infrastructure to deliver
web pages, file sharing and
email services.

<h2 style="background-color:#FCBFB2;"> HTML </h2>
<p> HTML <mark><b> (Hypertext Markup Language) </b> </mark> is used to create document
on the World Wide Web. It is simply a collection of certain key
words called ‘Tags’ that are helpful in writing the document to be
displayed using a browser on Internet.
It is a platform independent language that can be used on any
platform such as Windows, Linux, Macintosh, and so on.</p>
<blockquote>
HTML’s primary function is to define the structure of
a document using a tagging system; allows web
browsers to present web pages using a standardised
language.<br>
Originally used to create content and apply style
information to web pages: defines which parts of a
document are headings, paragraphs, tables etc; and
can be used to define how each section is
presented.<br>
Latest iteration is HTML5, which introduced tags for
multimedia content to be displayed natively in
HTML.<br>

To display a document in web it is essential to mark-up the different
elements (headings, paragraphs, tables, and so on)*** of the
document with the HTML tags.
To view a mark-up document,user has to open the document in a browser.
</blockquote>
 <p > A browser understands and interpret the HTML tags, identifies the structure
of the document (which part are which) and makes decision about
presentation (how the parts look) of the document.</p>

<p><em>HTML also provides tags to make the document look attractive
using graphics, font size and colors.<br> User can make a link to the
other document or the different section of the same document
by creating Hypertext Links also known as Hyperlinks.</em></p>
